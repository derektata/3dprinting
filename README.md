# Welcome!
This is a small repo containing my 3D printing presets for **Ultimaker Cura** and
**PrusaSlicer**. Along with some notes on the settings for the materials I print with.

### DD Ender 3

##### Modified Parts:

-- **PrinterMods MDD Plate v1**

- Although this is an earlier model, it still was able to mount the new HMG5
  Cooling system, but there is a newer version available!
  
- Link to v1.2: [PrinterMods MDD Kit v1.2](https://printermods.com/products/direct-drive-mod-for-creality-ender-3-cr-10)

-- **HeroMeGen5 w/ Dual 5015 Part Cooling Ducts**

- This cooling duct is rock solid and helps out tremendously on really steep overhangs

-- **40mm Noctua Heatsink Cooling Fan for Hotend**

- I've noticed a considerable less amount of heat creep since switching to this
  fan, and have been able to print for longer since.

-- **BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 v2.0 Mainboard**

- This is the best bang for buck upgrade that you could spend on your machine.
